# Mini_Project
Assume there are three types of threads in the system, A, B, and C. There is buffer with size of 1 between A and B, where A writes data into the buffer and B reads data from the buffer; and another buffer of size 1 between B and C, where B writes the data read from the first buffer into this one, and C reads the data from it.

You are asked to implement such a system with 

1) busy waiting synchronization mechanism 
2) semaphore
